# Pacman Game with Solana Blockchain Betting

## About My Game

This project is a modern Pacman game that integrates Solana blockchain technology, allowing players to bet with their scores. As you play, your in-game performance directly impacts your betting outcomes, thanks to Solanaâ€™s fast, secure, and low-cost decentralized infrastructure. The game features the same nostalgic Pacman experience while introducing a competitive edge by leveraging blockchain for real-time score-based betting.

### Key Features:
- Play the classic Pacman arcade game.
- Bet your score using Solana tokens (SOL) through smart contracts.
- Win based on your in-game performance, with decentralized escrow and payout systems.
- Powered by Solana's fast and scalable blockchain network.

## How to Play
   
1. **Start the Game**: Navigate the Pacman maze, collect pellets, avoid ghosts, and achieve a high score.

2. **Navigate to the bet screen**: https://solana-pacman-client.vercel.app/test

2. **Connect Your Wallet**: Ensure you have a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) set up in your browser. The game integrates with your wallet for blockchain interactions.

3. **Place Your Bet**: Before the game starts, you'll have the option to bet a portion of your score in SOL. The bet amount is transferred into an escrow account managed by a smart contract.

4. **Win and Get Rewards**: If you reach the target score, the smart contract releases the bet amount and any winnings back to your wallet.

5. **Play Again**: Test your skills, challenge friends, and earn more by replaying and placing additional bets!

### Requirements:
- A Solana wallet extension (like Phantom) installed in your browser.
- SOL tokens in your wallet to place bets.
